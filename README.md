# IMDb-unofficial
This project is a result of a 2-Day Guided Product  Development Competition held by QUALLAB. In this project, I have used a free API from Rapidapi.com to get the required data.
The link to the API : https://rapidapi.com/hmerritt/api/imdb-internet-movie-database-unofficial/
API by Harry Merritt : https://rapidapi.com/user/hmerritt
The following API contains two endpoints namely "Film" and "Search".
The get "Search" endpoint returns movie titles ( with associated movie id and movie poster ) for a string as parameter.
The get "Film" endpoint returns all the required details about a particular movie like ratings, cast, runtime and a lot more. This endpoint requires movie id as a parameter.
